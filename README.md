In this project, we designed and developed software for a 10-question online exam system.
Users can mark questions for review while navigating to results and
click the Next button to advance to the next question. 
The online exam system meets the institution's requirements for conducting exams online.
Here we use a Java array to store the question, options and answers. No database technology is used. 
We enriched this project by using a Swing frame as a container and buttons and checkboxes as components.
The software gives students the option to select questions with increasing levels of complexity if they want to achieve higher points leading to higher grades.
So in this software he can provide 3 levels of problems (good, hard and complex) depending on the level of complexity. 
Scores are assigned according to student rules (example) best grades are achieved only with 80% or more correct answers 
for good questions and 25% and 10% correct answers for difficult and complex questions respectively increase. However, students are 
able to correctly answer larger questions from difficult or complex problems, reducing the need to answer questions correctly from good ones.
So I used a timer for a fixed amount of time to create a good rule for this decision.
